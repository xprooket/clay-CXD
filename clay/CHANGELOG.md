## [2.2.0] - 2025-06-12

### 🎬 MAJOR RELEASE: Context Tale & Auto-Briefing System

**NARRATIVE ENGINE**: Clay-CXD now generates fluid narratives from fragmented memories, solving the onboarding problem for new Claude instances.

### ✨ Added
- **🧠 Context Tale System (`clay_context_tale.py`)**
  - Generates coherent narratives from memory fragments using recall_cxd hybrid search
  - Intelligent text chunking for different token limits (500-1000 tokens)
  - Multiple narrative styles: introduction, technical, philosophical, general
  - Auto-style detection based on query content
  - Persistent .txt file generation in `/tales/` directory with metadata headers
  - MCP integration with full parameter support

- **🎬 Auto-Briefing for New Instances**
  - `status()` now provides automatic context briefing for new Claude instances
  - Configurable via simple variables in clay_status.py (martillo approach)
  - Session flag management to prevent repetitive briefings
  - Uses context_tale for rich, contextual introductions vs basic bootstrap

- **🔗 Memory Reference System**
  - All context_tale narratives include memory ID placeholders `[ID:?]`
  - Clear guidance: "To find specific IDs, use `recall('key words from memory')`"
  - Smart search indicators showing hybrid semantic search usage
  - Enables follow-up actions: `recall(ID)`, `update_memory_guided(ID)`

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Context Tale Engine**
  - Built on recall_cxd for semantic relevance vs simple keyword matching
  - Token estimation and safe text chunking preserving narrative flow
  - Chunk metadata includes: chunk_id, total_chunks, token_count, style, query
  - Generation time tracking and performance logging

- **Auto-Briefing Architecture**
  - Simple variable-based configuration (no JSON/YAML complexity)
  - Flag-based session tracking with 24-hour reset cycle
  - Integrated into existing status() workflow without breaking changes
