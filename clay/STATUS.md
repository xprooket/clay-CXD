# 📊 Clay-CXD Project Status

**Last Updated**: June 10, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Repository**: [github.com/xprooket/clay-CXD](https://github.com/xprooket/clay-CXD)

## 🚦 Overall Status: **STABLE & FUNCTIONAL**

Clay-CXD is a working implementation of contextual memory intelligence for AI systems, built through human-AI collaboration and released as open source.

---

## ✅ What's Working

### Clay Memory System
- **🧠 Persistent Memory**: SQLite-based storage that survives across sessions
- **🔍 Hybrid Search**: Semantic understanding with keyword fallback
- **🔄 Reflection Tools**: Systems can examine and improve their own reasoning
- **🤝 Human-in-the-Loop**: Memory that humans can inspect, correct, and guide
- **📡 MCP Protocol**: Works with Claude and other LLMs via Model Context Protocol

### CXD Classification Framework
- **🎯 Cognitive Function Detection**: Understands the "why" behind text (Control/Context/Data)
- **🔀 Multiple Classification Methods**: Lexical, semantic, and meta-fusion approaches
- **🧪 Extensible Architecture**: Easy to adapt for domain-specific cognitive patterns
- **⚡ Production Ready**: Optimized classifiers for real-time applications

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Clay Memory System:**
- Research assistants that remember sources and track evolving understanding
- Code review systems that maintain context across long development sessions
- Strategic planning tools that track decisions, rationale, and outcomes
- Learning systems that build knowledge that compounds over time

**CXD Classification (Independent):**
- Intent detection to understand functional purpose in user queries
- Workflow analysis to classify business process documents by cognitive function
- Content categorization to organize text by what it's trying to accomplish
- AI agent coordination to route tasks based on cognitive function needed

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xprooket/clay-CXD.git
cd Clay-CXD

# Install Clay dependencies
cd clay && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install CXD Classifier (standalone)
cd ../cxd-classifier && pip install -e .[all]

# Start Clay MCP server
cd ../clay && node server.js
```

### Using CXD Independently
```python
from cxd_classifier import create_optimized_classifier

clf = create_optimized_classifier()
result = clf.classify("Search for files related to the current project")
print(result.pattern)  # e.g. C+X?D-
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

Both Clay and CXD include comprehensive test suites:

```bash
# Test core Clay functionality
cd clay && pytest tests/

# Test CXD classification
cd cxd-classifier && pytest tests/
```

---

## 🛠️ Development

### Active Development
- **Regular updates** to improve memory accuracy and classification performance
- **Community contributions** welcome for extending capabilities
- **Documentation improvements** based on user feedback

### Architecture
- **Two complementary tools**: Clay (memory) + CXD (classification)
- **Independent utility**: Each tool valuable on its own
- **Modular design**: Easy to extend and adapt for specific use cases
